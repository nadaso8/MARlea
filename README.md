# GABleae

A project aiming at revamping Aleae, a tool for "Stochastic Simulation of Molecular Reactions", written by Marc Riedel of the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities.
The original project is available here: https://cctbio.ece.umn.edu/aleae/

This is very much expirimental and just written for fun. Don't expect this to be completely accurite. We aren't biologists or chemists.
