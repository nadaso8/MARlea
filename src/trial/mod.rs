/// # Description
/// This code provides a Trial struct and its implementation for simulating a reaction network.
///  The ReactionNetwork module contains all the necessary details about this network, including species, reactions, and terms.
/// The simulation process is performed using the Simulate() function in the implementation of Trial. 
/// It takes a mutable reference to a trial, evaluates its current status, and runs reactions until the network reaches a stable state.
/// 
/// # Usage
/// To use this code, you need to import the ReactionNetwork module and create an instance of ReactionNetwork<'trial>, then create an instance of Trial by passing this instance as an argument.
/// You can then run simulations on this Trial instance using the simulate() function.
/// It returns a HashMap containing all the species keyd by their references in the stable network solution.
